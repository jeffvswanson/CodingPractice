/*
FAN OUT
Multiple functions reading from the same channel until that channel is closed.

FAN IN
A function can read from multiple inputs and proceed until all are closed by
muliplexing the input channels onto a single channel that's closed when all
inputs are closed.

PATTERN
There's a pattern to our pipeline functions:
-- stages close their outbound channels when all the send operations are done.
-- stages keep receiving values from inbound channels until those channels are
closed.fmt
